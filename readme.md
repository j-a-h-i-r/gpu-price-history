A small utility Backend and API to check GPU prices and view price/availability trends.

> Right now, this project is hyper-local and only really useful for getting GPU prices in Bangladesh.

#### Why?

I got tired of manually refreshing GPU listings to see if there's any updates

### Features

Currently, following features are implemented,
- Scraping price and availability information on regular intervals
- API to get historical GPU price/availability data
- Get email alerts when GPU price/availability changes
- Compare the price/availability of multiple GPUs under same model number 

A frontend client for easy viewing is in progress...
